# Hillandweb2022 / Full Stack Open project for Helsinki University

This is a web application for Hilland Records. The main purpose is to serve clients with up to date info about weekly Hilland Mondays live music club, releases, etc.

Optional later development idea is to maintain a database for Hilland Mondays musicians to keep songlist up to date.

These two tasks will joint to each other, since the everyday users can make song requests, vote favourite songs, see latest songlist, etc.

My main purpose was to learn to be able to use images in React-Node app, and my solution is to use Amazon AWS S3 for uploading and fetching images and Localstack fortesting/dev.
